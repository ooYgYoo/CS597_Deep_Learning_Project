Skin Disease classification using deep learning 

* The algorithm will classify the type of skin disease based on the patient's pictures
  * Data set				: 877 pictures from [DermNet NZ](https://www.dermnetnz.org/image-library/ ) 
  * Data Split			: Training: 80%, Validation: 10%, Test: 10%
  * Framework		         	: Keras and Tensorflow 
  * Neural Network Architecture     	: Convolutional Neural Networks 
  * Accuracy  		         	: 62% in raw data and 75% after data augmentation 
  * Impact	    		         	: Automatically classify skin diseases through the input pictures
      and give a probability of each potential disease
